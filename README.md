### Todo List
This Todo list was created using js & react in front-end and spring boot & java in back-end.

This is a very simple app, there is a input and a submit button so you can add a new task to the list. The list of tasks have 3 buttons to make changes in tasks like check, reset status and delete. The history have 2 buttons, one of them to delete a task and the other to restore a task.
