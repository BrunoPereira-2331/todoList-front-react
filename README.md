### Todo List
This Todo list was created using js & react in front-end and spring boot & java in back-end. Was a good challenge, i'm a newbie in js, recently i had courage to jump in this language and try to learn more about it, for my surprise i just love it.

this app is very simple, there are a input, submit button, so you can add a new task to the list, and the list of tasks. The list of tasks have 3 buttons to make changes in tasks like check, reset status and delete. There are a few things that i need to add, like history.
